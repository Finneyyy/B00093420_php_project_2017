PHP Site for dr-matt-smiths web dev server side class

### IMPORTANT

This project page has two folders. **Original** and **Current**.

The **original** folder contains files completed before 12pm on the 14/12/17. These files have not been changed after the given date. Nor have they been tested.

The **current** folder contains files that are (as of after 12pm, 14/12/17) being updated/changed. 

#### When I am happy with my site (~~ETA: Somewhere around the 25th of December~~), I will post the final version of the site under the comment, 'Final Version'. 
##### EDIT: Due to real life matters, the final version will be sometime before the new year, i.e: most likely 31st of December

Signing off, for now.

Currently (on the night of the 24/12/17, running into Christmas Day), I'm troubleshooting this blasted project. It turns out, its a pain in the bollox. I'll be finished when I'm finished, and/or give up. 

But not fully give up. I think when I'm done with it, I'll keep coming back to it. Maybe to add to it, maybe not.

#### Done
Turns out I've given up. Who'd would have guessed it? (Meself, btw).

### Project Thoughts
It was definitely a **lot** bigger and more complex than I thought it would be. I underestimated the amount of work I would have to do to complete the site, and it probably shows.

Oh well. There's always next time. And by that, I mean the repeat in August.

##### Signing off, for good
I think...

### IMPORTANT

This project page has two folders. **Original** and **Current**.

The **original** folder contains files completed before 12pm on the 14/12/17. These files have not been changed after the given date. Nor have they been tested.

The **current** folder contains files that are (as of after 12pm, 14/12/17) being updated/changed. 

#### When I am happy with my site (~~ETA: Somewhere around the 25th of December~~), I will post the final version of the site under the comment, 'Final Version'. 
##### EDIT: Due to real life matters, the final version will be sometime before the new year, i.e: most likely 31st of December

Signing off, for now.

Currently (on the night of the 24/12/17, running into Christmas Day), I'm troubleshooting this blasted project. It turns out, its a pain in the bollox. I'll be finished when I'm finished, and/or give up. 

But not fully give up. I think when I'm done with it, I'll keep coming back to it. Maybe to add to it, maybe not.
